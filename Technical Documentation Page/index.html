                    <p>Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes
                        code readability with the use of significant indentation.</p>
                    <p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                        including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It
                        is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
                    </p>
                    <p>Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming
                        language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python
                        3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier
                        versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured
                        programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and
                        aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming and metaobjects). Many other paradigms
                        are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming.</p>
                    <p>Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage
                        collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds
                        method and variable names during program execution.</p>
                    <p>Its core philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such
                        as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
                        <li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
                        <li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
                        <li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
                        <li>Readability counts.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <h2>Syntax and Semantics</h2>
                        <hr>
                    </header>
                    <p>Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and
                        often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages,
                        it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed
                        but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.</p>
                    <h3>Indentation</h3>
                    <p>Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An
                        increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the
                        end of the current block. Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its
                        semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule. Some other languages use
                        indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent
                        size is four spaces.</p>
                    <h3>Data types and Operators</h3>
                    <p><b>Data types: </b>Data types in Python include Integers, Float, Strings, List, Tuple,
                        Dictionary, Set, Boolean. A programmer does not need to explicitly mention the type of variable
                        they are creating.</p>
                    <code>num = 15 # integer number<br>
      val = 17.8746 # floating point number<br>
      tag = "Hello123" # string of characters<br>
      boo = False # boolean variable<br><br>
      # list of data which are mutable<br>
      arr = [4,'Snake',True]<br><br>
      # tuple of data which are immutable<br>
      mat = (1,'Orange',3.1452)<br><br>
      # dictionary of values having unique key<br>
      dic = {'A':True,'B':17, 'C':'Juice'}<br><br>
      # set of unique data<br>
      vec = {7,4.269,'Yes'}</code>
                    <p><b>Operators: </b>Used to operate on the variable. They include arithematic and logical
                        operators.</p>
                    <code>5.32 + 15 = 20.32 # addition<br>
      "Py" + "thon" = "Python" # concatenation<br>
      6.72 - 2 = 4.72 # subtraction<br>
      5 * 9 = 45 # multiplication<br>
      4 ** 2 = 16 # power<br>
      8 / 2 = 4.0 # division<br>
      8 // 3 = 2 # integer division<br>
      10 % 3 = 1 # modulo operator<br>
      a >= b # a is greater than equal to b<br>
      a <= b # a is less than equal to b<br>
      a == b # a is equal to b<br>
      a != b # a is not equal to b<br>
      a and b # logical AND<br>
      a or b # logical OR<br>
      not a # logical not</code>
                    <h3>Control Statements</h3>
                    <p><b>Conditional Statements: </b>An if, elif and else statements are used to control the flow of
                        program execution through various logical condition and it will onnly execute the content of the
                        if or elif block if their respective condition is True. A else block does not take any logical
                        condition and will through syntax error if provided. It is used so that if all the above cases
                        fail then it will provide a default value.</p>
                    <code>if condition1 == True:<br>
      ‎ ‎ # execute this if block<br>
      elif condition2 == True:<br>
      ‎ ‎ # execute this elif block instead<br>
      else:<br>
      ‎ ‎ # execute this else block if condition1<br>
      ‎ ‎ # and condition2 fails</code>
                    <p>If the condition is same and only the right part of the condition is varying then we can
                        implement match-case concept which was recently introduced in Python 3.10</p>
                    <code>match condition:<br>
      ‎ ‎ case val1:<br>
      ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ # execute this block<br>
      ‎ ‎ case val2:<br>
      ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ # execute this block<br>
      ‎ ‎ default:<br>
      ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ #acts like else block</code>
                    <p><b>Looping: </b>If we have to execute a set of instructions repeatedly for certain number of
                        times we can for loops as well as while loop. A for loop in python takes the parameter in range
                        function which describes number of times the content of for loop will be executed. It takes
                        start value, stop value and increment value. The default start value and increment value is 0
                        and 1 respectively. It should be noted that the stop value is not included since looping starts
                        from 0.</p>
                    <code>for i in range(s,e,i):<br>
      ‎ ‎ # where s = start_value<br>
      ‎ ‎ # e = end_value<br>
      ‎ ‎ # i = increment_value<br>
      ‎ ‎ # this loop will run e-s/i times</code>
                    <p>Another type of loop is while loop. It keeps on executing the contents of while loop until the
                        given conditions fails. This type of loop is suitable if we do not know the number of times a
                        specific block must be looped over. It is important to change the given condition to the while
                        loop to avoid looping infinitely.</p>
                    <code>while(condtion == True):<br>
      ‎ ‎ # execute this block<br>
      ‎ ‎ # change the condition</code>
                    <p>A break statement can be used to exit from a loop whereas a continue statement is used to skip
                        the current iteration and jump to next iteration without executing further code in the current
                        iteration.</p>

                    <p>Python's large standard library provides tools suited to many tasks and is commonly cited as one
                        of its greatest strengths. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols
                        such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces,
                        connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with
                        arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.</p>
                    <p>A Python framework is a collection of Python modules that provides a set of common functionality
                        that can be used as a structure for building applications of any type.</p>
                    <p>Frameworks are designed to simplify the development process by providing a general guideline on
                        how we should build software and abstracting away some of the more complex or repetitive tasks.
                        This allows you to focus on writing unique and custom logic for your applications, rather than
                        having to reinvent the wheel.</p>
