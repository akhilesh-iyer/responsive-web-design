        <p id='tribute-info'>Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (September 9, 1941 – c. October 12, 2011) was an American
            computer scientist. He is best known for creating the C programming language and, with long-time colleague
            Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system and B programming language. Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the
            Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of
            Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999. Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software
            Research Department when he retired in 2007. He was the "R" in K&R C, and commonly known by his username
            dmr.</p>
        <p>Here's the timeline of Dennis Ritchie's life:</p>

            <li><span class="heading">1983 </span>
                <span>Ritchie and Thompson received the Turing Award "for their development of generic operating systems
                    theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system"</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="heading">1997 </span>
                <span>Ritchie and Thompson were made Fellows of the Computer History Museum, "for co-creation of the
                    UNIX operating system, and for development of the C programming language"</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="heading">1999 </span>
                <span> Thompson and Ritchie jointly received the National Medal of Technology of 1998 from President
                    Bill Clinton for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="heading">2005 </span>
                <span>Industrial Research Institute awarded Ritchie its Achievement Award in recognition of his
                    contribution to science and technology, and to society generally, with his development of the Unix
                    operating system</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="heading">2007 </span>
                <span>Ritchie was transferred to Lucent Technologies in mid 1990s, where he retired as head of System
                    Software Research Department</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="heading">2011 </span>
                <span>Ritchie, along with Thompson, was awarded the Japan Prize for Information and Communications for
                    his work in the development of the Unix operating system</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="heading">2011 </span>
                <span>Dies at the age of 70 at his home in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Following Ritchie's death, computer historian Paul E. Ceruzzi stated:</p>
        <em id="quote">"Ritchie was under the radar. His name was not a household name at all, but... if you had a
            microscope and could look in a computer, you'd see his work everywhere inside."</em>
